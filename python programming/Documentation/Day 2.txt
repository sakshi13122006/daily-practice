***** PYTHON BASICS *****

1. INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON 
   - Python is a high-level, interpreted, and easy-to-learn programming language. It is widely used in Web Development, Data      Science, artificial Intelligence, Automation ans Software development.

   Features of Python:
   - Simple and easy
   - Interpreted language
   - Platform Independent
   - Large standard library

   SOME BASIC RULES F PYTHON:
   - Indentation is Mandatory
   - Python is case-sensitive
   - Variables do not need declaration
   - statements end without semicolon
   - dynamic typing 

2. PYTHON SYNTAX (Hello World)
    - print("Hello World!!!!)

3. VARIABLES AND DATA Types
    VARIABLES - stores the data value.
    ex;
        x = 10
        name = "Piu"

   DATA Types
    Data type specifies the type of value a variable can store, such as interger, float, string or boolean
   - int(Integer)
   - float (decimal)
   - str (String)
   - bool (Boolean)

   ex;
      age = 18
      height = 5.8
      is_student = true


4. TYPE CASTING
   - converting one data type into another.

   TYPES OF TYPE CASTING
   4.1 Implicit CASTING
      - Automatically done by Python.
      - Smaller data type conveerted into larger data type.
      - ex;
           x = 5   #int
           y = 2.5 # float
           z = x + y #x is implicitly convertedto float
           priny(z)

   4.2 Explicit CASTING
     - Done by programmer using functions like int(), float(), str()
     -ex;
         x = 5.7
         y = int(x)   #float to int
         z = str(y)   #int to string
         print(y , z)


5. OPERATORS
    - An operator is a symbol used to perform operations on variables that produces result.

    5.1 arithemetic operator

       OPERATORS      Meaning          Example
          +           Addition          5+3=8
          -           Substraction      5-3=2
          *           Multiplication    5*3=15
          /           Division          5/2=2.5
          //          Floor Division    5//2=2
          %           Modulus           5%2=1

          a = 100
          b = 70

           print("Addition: ", a + b)
           print("Sustraction: ", a - b)
           print("Multiplication: ", a * b)
           print("Division: ", a / b)
           print("Floor Division: ", a // b)
           print("Modulus: ", a % b)
           print("Exponent: ", a ** b)

        Output:
           Addition:  170
           Sustraction:  30
           Multiplication:  7000
           Division:  1.4285714285714286

            b = 4
            print(a == b)
            print( a != b)
            print(a > b)
            print(b > a)

            Output:
               False
               True
               True
               False

         OPRATORS         MEANING                    
          and             true if both are true     
          or              true if any is true
          not             reverse boolean value     

          a = 5
          b = 3
          print(a > 0 and b > 0)
          print(a > 0 or b < 0 )
          print(not(a > b))

         Output:
              True
              True
              False   


   5.4 ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
           OPERATORS          MEANING
            =                  Assign
            +=                 Add and assign 
            -=                 substarct and assign 
            *=                 multiply and assign

         OPERATOR     MEANING          EXAMPLE
          &           AND              5&3=1
          ^           XOR              5^3 = 6
          ~           NOT              ~5=-6
          <<          left shift       5<<1=10
          >>          Right shift      5>>1=2

               6
               -6
               10
               2


   6. INPUT AND OUTPUT 
       
        - Input is the data provided by the user
        - Output is the result produced by the program after execution

       name = input("enter your name: ")
       print("Hello", name)


   7. COMMENTS
      - A comment in a line in a program that is ignored by the python interpreter and is used to explain the code.

       SIGNLE LINE COMMENTS
        # this is a single line comment

      MULTI LINE COMMENT
        """
          This is a 
          multi line comment
        """ 


   8. FUNCTIONS 
      -  A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

        def greet():
                    print("Good Morning") 

            greet()

         Output:
                Good Morning


         def add(a, b)
                 return a + b 
               
         result = add(5, 3)
         print(result)

         Output: 8


   9. SCOPE OF VARIABLES
      - Scope of a variable referes to the region of a program whre that variable is recognized and accessible. Python has two main types of variable scope.

      LOCAL SCOPE:
            - Variables defined inside a function are only accessible within that function.

      GLOBAL SCOPE:
            - Variables defined outside any function are accessible throughput the program.

      Example;
              x = 10  #global variable
              def show():
                 x = 5  #local variable
                 print("Inside function, x:", x)  #Output: Inside function, x: 5

              show()
              print("Output function,x:", x) #output: Outside function, x: 10



                ************ DECISION MAKING IN PYTHON ************
   
      - Decision making allows the program to execute different blocks of code based on conditions.

      TYPES:
          1. if statement 
          2. if-else Statement 
          3. if-elif-else statement
          4. Nested if

        1. if statement:
             - Executes a block of code only if the condition is true.

             Syntax:
                   if condition:
                        # block of code to execute if condition is true

             Example:
                    age = 18
                    if age >= 18:
                              print("you are eligible to vote.")


         2. if-else Statement:
                - executes one block if the condition is true and another block if the condtion is false.

               Syntax:
                      if condition:
                              # block of code if condition is true
                      else:
                              # block of cde is the condition is false

               Example:
                       age = 16
                       if age >= 18:
                              print("you can vote")
                       else:
                            print("you cannot vote")


         3. if-elif-else statement:
                  - Used when thre are multiple conditions to check. Python executes the first true contion if finds.

               syntax:
                     if condition1:
                             # block of code if condition1 is true

                     elif condition2:
                              # block of code if condition2 is true
             
                     else:
                              #block of code if the all conditions are false


               Example:
                        marks = 75
                        if marks >= 90:
                                     print("Grade A")
                        elif marks >= 75:
                                     print("Grade B")
                        elif marks >= 50:
                                     print ("Grade C")
                        else:
                             print("Fail")


            4. Nested if Statement:
                  - An if or if...else statement inside another if statement.

                  Syntax:
                        if condition1:
                            if condition2:
                                 # block of code if both conditions are true

                  Example:
                        num = 10
                        if num > 0:
                             if num % 2 == 0;
                                 print("Positive even number")
