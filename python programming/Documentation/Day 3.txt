********* LOOPS  ********
- Loops are used to repeat block of codemultiple times until the condition is satisfied.

There are two types of Loops used in Python:
          1. while loop
          2. for loop 
          3. nested loop 

    1. while loop
       - while loop executes a set of statement as long as a condition is true.
         (This loop is used when number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition.)
       Example;
               print i as long as i is less than 6
                
                i = 1
                while i < 6:
                       print(i)
                       i += 1
   
                Output:  1
                         2
                         3
                         4
                         5

       
    
     2. for loop 
        - we use for loop repeat a block of code a fixed number of times or to iterate over sequence like lists, tuple, string, range
        (when we know the number of iterations.)
        - Example:
                  for i in range(3):
                        print("Hello")

                Output:
                    Hello
                    Hello
                    Hello
               

                   name = "Sakshi"
                   for ch in name:
                          print(ch)
                    
                Output:
                        S  
                        a 
                        k 
                        s 
                        h 
                        i


      3. nested loop 
         - nested loop means loop inside loop
         - Example:
                  for row in range(1, 4):
                     for star in range(1, 4):
                           print("*", end=" ")
                           print()

                Output:
                       * * *
                       * * *
                       * * *


        - BREAK Statement
          - Using break statement we can stop the execution of loop even if the while condition is true.
          - Example:
                    i = 1
                    while i < 6:
                         print(i)
                         if (i == 3):
                              break;
                         i += 1

                    Output:
                              1
                              2
                              3


        -CONTINUE Statement
           - Using continue statement we can stop current iteration and run next one.
           - Example:
                     i = 1
                     while i < 6:
                             print(i)
                             if (i == 3):
                               continue
                               i += 1
                    Output:
                            1
                            2
                            4
                            5
                            6

        
        - The else statement:
            - using else statement we can run block of code once when the condition no longer is true.
            - Example:
                      i = 1
                      while i < 6:
                            print(i)
                            i += 1
                      else:
                           print("i is no longer less than 6")



           *************** DATA STRUCTURE IN PYTHON ***************
  
     - Data structure are ways of organizing and storing data so you can access and modify it efficiently.
     - It provides built in data structures like list, tuple, set and dictionaries.

     1. LIST 
       - A list stores a sequence of items in order. You can change elements after creation.
       - Features:
                  - Ordered
                  - mutable
                  - allows duplicates

       - Operations:
                  - sort 
                  - reverse
                  - remove
                  - update
                  - append
                  - insert
                  - extend 

      - Example:
            nums = [10, 20, 30, 40]
            nums.append(50)
            print(nums[0])  
         
         Output: 10


     2. Tuple:
        - tuple is like list but it is immutable we cannot modified it after it's creation.
        - Features:
                  - ordered 
                  - immutable 
                  - allows duplicates

         - Operations:
                      - len (we can fint out the length)
                      - count (we can get how many times an item appears)
                      - index (we can also get an item by an index)
            
         - Example:
                point = (3, 4)
                print(point[1]) 

            Output: 4


     3. set :
         -  A set is a collection of unordered unique items.
         - Feature:
                   - unordered
                   - mutable
                   - no duplicates

         - Opeartions:
                   - add
                   - remove
                   - discard
                   - union
                   - intersection
                   - difference

          - Example:
                  fruits = {"apple", "banana", "orange"}
                  fruits.add("mango")

               Output:
                      {"apple", "banana", "orange", "mango"} 

      
     4. dictionary :
          - a dictionary is collection of key-value pair. but in this key must be unique, value can be repeat.
          - Features:
                   - unordered
                   - mutable
                   - very fast look up by key

         - Operations:
                  - add
                  - update
                  - remove
                  - we can also get keys ,avlues and pair by using their words.

         - Example:
                   dict = {"name": "Asha", "roll-no": 22 }
                   print(dict["name"])

                   Output: Asha
